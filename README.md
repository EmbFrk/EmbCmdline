# EmbCmdline
Generic commandline Interpreter for embedded systems

I created several small systems which provide a command line interpreter.
Over the time I found it usefull to have an easy way of creating and configuring the commands.
Now I think this is a nice basis for sharing the framework.

This code contains:
1. a simple and small line editor
2. the command line interpreter fed by the editor

If you like it:
It would be nice if you share it.

If you don't like it:
It would be nice to know why that's the case.

If you use it:
Take it, modify it as you like.
I would really like to get the information where you use it for.

Just drop me an email:
